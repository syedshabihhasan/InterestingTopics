    "From historic data, if she spent sleeping a sad day away. The next day it is 60% likely she will go for a run, 20% she will stay in bed the next day and 20% chance she will pig out on icecream.\n",

    "When she is sad and goes for a run, there is a 60% chances she'll go for a run the next day, 30% she gorges on icecream and only 10% chances she'll spend sleeping the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when she indulges on icecream on a sad day, there is a mere 10% chance she continues to have icecream the next day as well, 70% she is likely to go for a run and 20% chance that she spends sleeping the next day.\n",

    "The Markov Chain depicted in the state diagram has 3 possible states: sleep, run, icecream. So, the transition matrix will be 3 x 3 matrix. Notice, the arrows exiting a state always sums up to exactly 1, similarly the entries in each row in the transition matrix must add up to exactly 1 - representing probability distribution. In the transition matrix, the cells do the same job that the arrows do in the state diagram.\n",
